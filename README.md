#The PyMovie video editing software is a suite of video editing tools.

#The PyMovie video editing software supports almost all the video and audio formats.

#The PyMovie video editing software also acts as a video editing module.

The second beta of PyMovie is here with roating features, audio control features, and more.

But what is the purpose of PyMovie if you can just import the MoviePy module in a Python file.

Well, not everyone knows how to code. Not everyone knows which functions and methods to use to get the result that they want. Not everyone knows what code to right to get the result that they want. Well, in PyMovie, the code is already written and you just have to tell the code stuff like the width size, the volume, etc.

When I release the GUI version of PyMovie, everything will changed. You will not have to open the code. You will just have to open the app and click on the buttons and stuff. 
Then, PyMovie will evolve into a large and completely different project. But it will still be based on the MoviePy module.

The PyMovie video editing software would not have been possible without the open-source module MoviePy, along with NumPy, Decorator, tqdm, PyGame, and ImageMagick modules. Pls make sure that you have installed these modules.

First, download Python 3.10.1 from python.org.
Then, install VSCode from: https://code.visualstudio.com/
Then, download the zip folder for this release.
Then, open this Python file in the folder.
Open the terminal in this file using VSCode. 
Next, install MoviePy(which automatically installs NumPy, Decorator, and tqdm.) by typing "pip install moviepy" in the terminal. 
Next, install PyGame by typing "pip install pygame" in the terminal. 
Next, install ImageMagick from: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php ImageMagick is optional as it will only be used if you want to add text to your videos. 

We are planning a GUI version of PyMovie to be released in 2022.
