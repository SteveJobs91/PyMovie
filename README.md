The PyMovie video editing software would not have been possible without the open-source module MoviePy, along with NumPy, Decorator, tqdm,
PyGame, and ImageMagick modules. Pls make sure that you have installed these modules.

First, download Python 3.10.1 from python.org
Then, install VSCode from: https://code.visualstudio.com/
Then, open this file.
Open the terminal in this file using VSCode.
Next, install MoviePy(which automatically installs NumPy, Decorator, and tqdm.) by typing "pip install moviepy" in the terminal.
Next, install PyGame by typing "pip install pygame" in the terminal.
Next, install ImageMagick from: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php
ImageMagick is optional as it will only be used if you want to add text to your videos.
